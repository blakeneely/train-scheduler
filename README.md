# Train Scheduler

## Description

Welcome to my first attempt at using Firebase. This is a scheduling app, use the form at the bottom to add a train, first time it runs and how often. Vanilla JavaScript writes to a database for storage, Moment.js handles the time math and formatting, jQuery displays all of the info into the table on top and Bootstrap handled most of the styling.
